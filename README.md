## Git vs. GitHub

##### Git is a **version control system** that tracks changes in source code during software developement. Github is a **cloud based** service that hosts git. You can set up your github account by going to [GitHub](github.com), and creating an account by verifying your account and by proving your're human..

---
## Initial Setup

##### You can also use the CS50 IDE, which will be the place where you will be working. You can go and login by going to the [ide website](ide.cs50.io), and by creating an account by using a email and password.


---
## Repository Setup

##### To create a repo you can use `git init` in the directory you want to work in, and create a repo on the github website with the same name of the directory you're working on.


---
## Workflow & Commands

##### First, you make any changes you want and save the files by doing `command s`, next you add the file(s) by using `git add` and then commit by using `git commit`. Then you add the remote and then push to github by using the commands on the github repo.

### Extra Credit

##### If you used `git init` in the wrong directory you have to use `rm -rf .git` to uninitialize. You can also remove a repository remotely by going into the repo, and then clicking on settings, then go down until you see **delete this repo** and then confirm.
